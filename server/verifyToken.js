# Token as Cookie is sent to the client which is generated using secretKey ( process.env.JWT) which will be used to decode it
const token = jwt.sign({ id: user._id }, process.env.JWT);

# Verifying user using the access_token from client cookie
  jwt.verify(token, process.env.jwt, (err, user) => {});
- we take token = access_token that is stored as a cookie in the client 
  that comes automatically with the request object
- jwt.verify takes this token and extract original { id: user._id } from this token using the secret key
- we now update the request object by adding user too
- next() fxn will call the next immediate fxn
- id passed via the api end point and user.id extracted by above method is compared to validate user
